# MO2-alchemy
Personal project completed in MySQL. Take some data for potion ingredients in game Mortal Online 2 to create SELECT and JOIN statements and several procedures to show more information about individual potential potion combinations

BACKGROUND:
Mortal Online 2 is an online video game. One aspect of the game is alchemy, or the creation of potions. Some potions can be used to recovered a players health points. These potions include ingredients that recovered a base amount of hp as well as multiply the amount of hp a potion recovers.

PURPOSE:
Organize ingredients by several criteria, such as tier, location in the world within the game, what classification it fits in, and more. 
This is done by: 
-creating several specific and organized tables 
-utilizing a series of SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY statements.

Determine the amount of hp recovered and how much it costs to produce in gold, the in game currency, for a variety of potions made depending on the amount of each ingredient made and what tier of ingredient it is. 
This is done by: 
-setting up several procedures 
-LOOP statements
-inserting procedures within other procedures

This information and insights are then exported to Tableau for data visualization, referred to as "Visualization for 'Analysis for potion ingredients in video game Mortal Online 2' project (Tableau Public)" in the Projects section in Linkedin, or provided here:
